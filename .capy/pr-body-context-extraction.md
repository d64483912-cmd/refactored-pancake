# Real-time context extraction for sessions (AI-powered dashboards)

Changes
- Add AI-powered context extractor service using OpenRouter + Gemini Flash 1.5 (worker/services/context-extractor.ts)
- Add session data model and migration: automation_sessions, session_messages, session_integrations (worker/db/session-schema.ts) + drizzle/0001_rainy_kingpin.sql
- Add session routes with endpoints for CRUD, message persistence, context extraction, and integration management (worker/routes/session-routes.ts) and register in worker/routes/index.ts
- Add Session Dashboard UI with manual extract button and integration/requirements/tech stack panels (src/components/session/SessionDashboard.tsx)
- Add Session page with split view (dashboard + chat), auto-extraction every 3 user messages, and message persistence (src/pages/session.tsx)
- Register routes in app router (src/app.tsx)
- Add OPENROUTER_API_KEY to wrangler vars (wrangler.jsonc)

Nature of changes
- New feature: real-time conversation-driven context extraction and session dashboard population.

Impact
- Enables automatic identification and tracking of integrations, databases, requirements, constraints, and tech stack directly from chat.
- Non-breaking: existing routes and UI remain unchanged; new functionality is opt-in via /session.

Why
- Automates surfacing of key context to reduce manual setup and keep session metadata in sync with the conversation.
- Improves visibility and accelerates integration setup by auto-creating integration entries from detected mentions.

Summary
- Automate context extraction from chat to populate sessions in real-time
- Keep integrations, databases, and requirements synchronized with conversation
- Provide both automatic (every 3 user messages) and manual extraction triggers
