## Summary
- Add end-to-end session creation flow: users can describe a task, choose an agent, and create a new automation session that redirects to /new/:sessionId.
- Introduce sessions API and persistence to support automation sessions.
- Provide optional agents catalog page to pre-select an agent and prefill homepage via query params.

## Why
This enables the homepage to function as the primary entry point for starting automation work. The sessions API and schema give the app a durable record of sessions tied to the authenticated user, enabling future management/continuation of automations.

## Changes
- Frontend
  - src/pages/home.tsx: Transform UI to create sessions, agent selection modal, error/loading states, URL param support (agent, message), auth checks.
  - src/pages/agents.tsx: Optional dedicated agent selection page with capabilities/use cases, navigates back to home with pre-selected agent.
  - src/pages/new-session.tsx: Minimal details page for a newly created session.
  - src/app.tsx: Register /agents and /new/:sessionId routes.
- Worker (backend)
  - worker/db/schema.ts: Add automationSessions table (id, userId, title, initialMessage, agentType, status, timestamps).
  - worker/routes/session-routes.ts: CRUD endpoints guarded by auth; POST returns { sessionId } for redirect; registered in routes index.
  - worker/routes/index.ts: Mount /sessions routes.

## Type Safety & Quality
- Ran typechecks for app and worker — no errors.
- Followed Hono context typing and middleware usage.
- Avoided browser storage for app data; sessions persisted via Drizzle D1.

## Impact
- New schema table added; generate and run migrations prior to deploy (`bun run pre-deploy`).
- No breaking API changes to existing routes.

## Follow-ups (not blocking)
- Session list/management UI (dashboard) and agent execution logic.
- File attachment upload pipeline (stored for future use in UI only).
